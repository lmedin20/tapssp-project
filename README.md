# Rust Data Inspector

Project Description:
Rust Data Inspector is a command-line tool for exploring, filtering, and summarizing CSV datasets. The program allows users to apply custom filter expressions (for example, age > 30 and salary < 100000) and compute summary statistics such as count, mean, minimum, and maximum values for selected columns.

The project demonstrates how Rust’s ownership, borrowing, error handling, and type safety features can be applied to real-world data processing tasks. It also highlights the use of traits, generics, and modular design to create efficient and reliable systems software.

I'm aiming for a less complex version by week 7 and following it with a future version that will include advanced features like saving filtered outputs, visualizing distributions directly in the terminal, and possibly building a text-based interface for interactive data analysis.
